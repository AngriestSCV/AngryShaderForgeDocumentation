While the final shader is a composite work and can't be freely distributed due to including Poiyomi's code the generated modules themselves are yours to use and distribute as you see fit. Requirements Poiyomi 8 pro is required. The free version does not provide the required files and it will not be supported in the forseeable future Building A Module Pre Building The best way to use this tool is to find a slider or number that already exists in Poiyomi that you want to modify. Remember that you can sample from textures, sample audio link, write arbitrary logic. Your creativity is the limit. After a target has been selected right click the item in the inspector and enable animation. Then right click it again and right click \"Copy Property Name\" to copy the property name to your clipboard. Next right click in the project view that contains your files and go to Create > AngryLabs > Angry Shader Forge > Poiyomi Module This will create a new angrySF file that you can name. Double click it after selecting a name; this will open the module editor window or if one is already open it will open the new module in the existing window. Find the existing Output node and paste your property name into it's upper text area. Click the Add Property button to add this property as an avaliable output. At this point you are ready to move on to building your shader module. Nodes Shader Build Process There are 2 ways to build your module. The first is with the Full Send button that you can find near the top. This will build your module, make a copy of the modular shader that you have input, install your module, generate the final shader, and post process the shader. After this you can use your shader and the module you built will be avaliable. The second way is to open the Advanced panel by toggling on the Advanced Options control. This lists all of the steps required to build a shader. They each have a name and a tooltip. The full send button esentially clicks them one at a time and stops if one reports an error.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#angry-shader-forge-documentation","text":"Angry Shader Forge (ASF) is a tool for Unity that helps you author your own shader modules that integrate into Poiyomi Pro.

This enables creating a small snippet of functionality and essentially lets you copy paste it into the larger shader at generation time. ThryEditor This is a tool avaliable freely on github that forms the core of the Poiyomi shader lock system. This step optimize your shader by rewriting it and inlining some variables. This can be a problem for us as after these values are inlined we can no longer modify them with our modules. Animating a property prevents inlining and allows us to modify the value. Failure to do so with result in either a failed shader (pink) or a shader that just does not do what you expected when locked, but works fine when the shader is unlocked. Poiyomi's Shader When using Poiyomi 8 pro you have access to the shader modules that are used in the development of the shader. This gives us access to the \"Modular Shader System\" bits that we need to inject new code directly into the shader using the same tools used to create the main shader. Angry Shader Forge Module Angry Shader Forge generates ShaderModules in a format that is compatible with Poiyomi's shader. A module is compiled into a list of commands starting at the Output working back. This includes mangling the names of the shader variables so that they do not conflict with any other variables. The end result of this is that the property named in the Output module is changed at a stage in the Poiyomi shader before much has happened. This in essence allows you to have per pixel and per frame control over almost all values in the Poiyomi shader. Of note is that since we are modifying these values they must be animated. The shader locking process described above will inline these properties and prevent this tool from working if they are not animated.","title":"Deep Dive"},{"location":"core-concept/#understanding-the-angry-shader-forge-conecept","text":"","title":"Understanding the Angry Shader Forge conecept"},{"location":"core-concept/#modular-shaders","text":"Poiyomi 8 is built using the Modular Shader System which is the key to this working.

Instead of using the variables you requested wrapp them in braces like {{this}} . This will cause your variables to have their names mangled to match the values actually present in the shader. Input Time Returns the number of seconds since the world loaded. This is not synced. Property Allows creating a property thatt can be edited in your modules section of the material properties. If checked the Is Constant checkbox will cause the value to be used directly and it will not be avaliable for editing. The type of property can be selected from the dropdown.
